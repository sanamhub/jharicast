# Contributing

Jharicast is a .NET library and CLI that turns weather models, official Nepali warnings and road status into per-route assessments. Bug reports, fixes and documentation improvements are welcome. For a new
feature or an API change, open an issue first so the design can be agreed before you write code.

This project follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Report security problems as
described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not in a public issue.

## Setup

You need the .NET SDK version in [`global.json`](global.json). Nothing else.

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet test -c Release
```

Tests never call a live service. They use recorded fixtures and a fake clock.

## Pull requests

- Keep a pull request to one change. Small is easier to review.
- Add or update tests for any behaviour change.
- Public API changes go in `src/<project>/PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt`. The build fails if you forget.
- Add a line to the `Unreleased` section of [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for anything a user of
  the package would notice.
- A significant design decision gets an ADR in `docs/adr/`. ADRs are not edited after
  they are accepted; a later ADR supersedes an earlier one.
- CI must pass on Linux and Windows, including the Native AOT consumption check.
- If you used an AI tool, you are still the author: read every line, and be ready to explain it
  in review.

## Commit messages

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): summary`, in the
imperative, lower case, no trailing period. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`,
`test`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`. The body says why, not what. No AI attribution trailers.

## Code style

The rules in [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig) are enforced by the build. Public members need XML
documentation that says what the member does, what it returns and what breaks it. The full
writing rules are in [`.claude/skills/writing-style/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/writing-style/SKILL.md).
